# Advanced-Styling-with-Responsive-Design

The goal of the final project is to create your own  responsive website that not only adjusts to the screen size, but also to the user preferences. Your site will support  three distinct views - mobile, tablet, and large screens and react to the user settings of prefers-reduced motion and color scheme. 

The starter  is provided for you 
as a zip file.  You will need to edit the style.css file to modify the mobile view and add four media queries. You are free to make many personal choices in your submission, but you must fulfill the following requirements:

1. You must replace all of the images from the starter code. Make sure to include alt text.
2. 
3. You must replace all of the content in the paragraph tag from the starter code. 

4. Check your code through the w3validatorand make necessary changes.

5. Your mobile view must use a mobile-first approach (so no media queries for the mobile view) and

  a. Use a one column grid with a 10px gap between rows and columns.

5. Your tablet  view must trigger at 772px, not repeat unnecessary rules,  and:

  a. Use  a  two column grid
  b. Set the border radius on the figures to create a circular shape
  c. Set the last figure  to take up both columns

6. Your large screen  view must trigger at 992px, not repeat unnecessary rules,  and:

  a. Set  every third figure  to take up both columns.
  b. Remove the border radius from all of the figures.
  c. Make sure not to use max-width!!

7. Your prefers-reduced-motion media query must:

  a. Remove the scroll behavior

8. Assuming that your default color scheme is light, create a media query for dark colors that: 

  a. Change the background-color of the figures to a dark color.;
  b. Change the font color of the figures  to a lighter (possibly yellow-ish) color
  c. Change the border color of the figures  to black.

9. Run your code through the wave validator, particularly to check for color contrast error.  Fix any errors.
